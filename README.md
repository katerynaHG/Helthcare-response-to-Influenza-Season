# Healthcare Response to Influenza Season

Influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can range from mild to severe illness and can sometimes lead to death. Symptoms usually come on suddenly. In severe cases, influenza may result in complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and can necessitate medical intervention and hospital care.

## Project Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to establish a well-informed strategy for deploying temporary staff to healthcare facilities, determining both the timing and quantity required for each state to effectively handle the influenza season.

## Objective

The objective of my project is to optimize when and how much staff to deploy for effective care nationwide, particularly during the influenza season.

## Scope

This initiative covers healthcare facilities across all 50 U.S. states, with a specific emphasis on preparing for the upcoming influenza season.

## Key Questions

- What is Influenza?
- What age group is the most vulnerable to Influenza?
- What are the most vulnerable states for Influenza?
- What is the impact of population on the mortality rate?
- When is the peak for the Influenza season?
- What is the forecast of the mortality rate for the upcoming season?
